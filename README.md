# --Fast-Nearest-Neighbor-Search-with-Keywords
fast nearest neighbor search with keywords

 Finds the nearest restaurant using food as a keyword.   For example, instead of 
considering all the restaurants, a nearest neighbor query would instead ask for the restaurant that is the closest among those 
whose menus contain “steak, spaghetti, brandy” all at the same time.
